# Focal Beta Testing Guide

This guide covers every command in Focal. For each command there is a list of test cases — what to run, what to look for, and what constitutes a pass or fail.

---

## Before you start

### Prerequisites

- **macOS or Linux** (Windows not yet tested)
- **Python 3.10+** — `python3 --version`
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** — authenticated with `repo` and `project` scopes:
  ```bash
  brew install gh        # macOS; or see https://cli.github.com for Linux
  gh auth login
  gh auth refresh -s project
  gh auth status         # should show: Logged in + repo, project scopes
  ```
- **At least one GitHub repo** with open issues assigned to you
- A **GitHub Projects v2 board is not required** — the setup wizard can create one automatically

### How to install

**Option A — pipx (recommended for beta testers)**

This is the intended end-user experience. `pipx` installs `focal` into an isolated
environment so it doesn't conflict with anything else.

```bash
# Install pipx if you don't have it
pip3 install pipx
pipx ensurepath
# Restart your terminal, then:

pipx install focal-cli
focal --version        # should print the installed version
```

**Option B — git clone + editable install (recommended for contributors / debugging)**

Use this if you want to poke at the source, reproduce a bug, or test unreleased changes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leninmehedy/focal.git
cd focal
pip3 install -e .      # adds 'focal' to your PATH via the current checkout
focal --version
```

> On macOS you may need `pip3 install -e . --break-system-packages` if Python was
> installed via Homebrew without a virtual environment.

**Notation used in this guide:**
- ✅ Expected pass — the test should succeed with this output
- ❌ Expected failure — the command should fail gracefully with a clear error, not a traceback

## Installation

| # | Test | How to run | Expected result |
|---|------|-----------|-----------------|
| I1 | pipx install | `pipx install focal-cli` | Installs cleanly, no errors ✅ |
| I2 | focal command available | `which focal` after I1 | Path returned (e.g. `~/.local/bin/focal`) — not "not found" ✅ |
| I3 | focal --version | `focal --version` | Prints the installed version (e.g. `1.10.2`) ✅ |
| I4 | focal --help | `focal --help` | Usage text with all command groups: `board`, `pm`, `cache`, `reset` ✅ |
| I5 | Editable install | `git clone https://github.com/leninmehedy/focal.git && cd focal && pip3 install -e . && focal --version` | Same version output as I3 ✅ |
| I6 | Upgrade | `pipx upgrade focal-cli` | Upgrades to latest version; `focal --version` shows new version ✅ |
| I7 | Uninstall | `pipx uninstall focal-cli` | `focal` command no longer found ✅ |

---

## Setup

### `focal board setup`

The interactive wizard that creates `~/.focal/config.json`.

| # | Test | How to run | Expected result |
|---|------|-----------|-----------------|
| S1 | Fresh setup — auto-create board | `focal board setup` with no existing config, choose **1** (Create a new board) | Prompts for GitHub username and board title. Creates a Projects v2 board, adds recommended Status columns, then continues to repo selection. Creates `~/.focal/config.json` ✅ |
| S2 | Fresh setup — use existing board | `focal board setup` with no existing config, choose **2** (I already have a board) | Prompts for board URL, GitHub username, Done column name, repos. Creates `~/.focal/config.json` ✅ |
| S3 | Config file location | After S1 or S2, `cat ~/.focal/config.json` | File exists at `~/.focal/config.json` (not in the focal repo directory) ✅ |
| S4 | Board created on GitHub | After S1 | New board visible at `https://github.com/users/YOUR_USERNAME/projects` with Status field containing 7 recommended options ✅ |
| S5 | Re-run wizard — add repos | Re-run `focal board setup` when config already exists | Offers 4 choices: **Add repos**, **Edit repo list**, **Full reconfigure**, **Cancel**. Choosing "Add repos" appends to the `repos` array without touching other settings ✅ |
| S6 | Re-run wizard — full reconfigure | Choose "Full reconfigure" in S5 | Overwrites config from scratch ✅ |
| S7 | Cancel re-run | Choose "Cancel" when offered options | Exits cleanly with no changes ✅ |
| S8 | Status map created | After setup with mismatched status columns | `~/.focal/status_map.json` is created with translation mappings ✅ |
| S9 | Non-interactive — create board | `focal board setup --owner USER --repos owner/repo --create-board --board-title "My Board"` with no existing config | Runs without any prompts. Creates a new GitHub Projects board, writes `~/.focal/config.json` ✅ |
| S10 | Non-interactive — attach existing board | `focal board setup --owner USER --repos owner/repo --use-board --use-board-number N` | Runs without prompts. Reads Status field from existing board, writes config ✅ |
| S11 | Non-interactive — assignee default | `focal board setup --owner USER --repos owner/repo --create-board` (no `--assignee`) | `assignee` in config equals `owner` value ✅ |
| S12 | Non-interactive — partial flags fall through | `focal board setup --owner USER` (repos not given) | Falls through to interactive mode for missing values ✅ |

---

## Board sync

### `focal board sync`

Bidirectional sync between your personal board and origin repo project boards.

## End-to-end flow

Run these in sequence to validate the full workflow from scratch:

1. `focal board setup` — configure board and repos (S1)
2. `focal board sync` — verify issues appear on board (BS1, BS2)
3. `focal board status` — confirm column counts (ST1)
4. `focal pm init owner/repo` — bootstrap a test repo (PI1, PI2)
5. Edit `docs/focal/plan.md` — add an epic and two stories
6. `focal pm adopt-plan owner/repo` — verify dry-run output (AP1)
7. `focal pm adopt-plan owner/repo --apply` — create issues, check epics.md rendered (AP2, AP3)
8. `focal pm epic-create owner/repo --title "Test Epic" --sp 8` — create an additional epic (EC2)
9. `focal pm story-create owner/repo --epic E2 --title "Test Story" --sp 3` — create a story (SC2)
7. `focal pm plan owner/repo --weeks 1 --start $(date +%Y-%m-%d) --team "YOU:8"` — plan iteration (PL1)
8. `focal pm status owner/repo` — check dashboard (PS1)
9. `focal cache refresh owner/repo` — verify cache is current (CR1)
10. Close the test story on GitHub, then `focal cache refresh owner/repo` — verify status updated (CR2)
11. `focal pm retro owner/repo --iteration I1 --goal-met --went-well "Smooth" --to-improve "Nothing"` — log retro (RE1)
12. `focal pm velocity owner/repo` — check velocity table shows I1 (V1)
13. `focal pm remove-repo owner/repo` — unregister repo (RR1)
14. `focal reset --yes` — clean up everything (R3)
15. `focal board setup` — reconfigure from scratch (S1 again)
